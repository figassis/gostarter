        <h1 class="h1 mt-5 mb-3 text-dark">Terms of Service</h1>

        <p>SaaS Company ("we", "us", "our", "Your SaaS Company, Inc.") provides a software-as-a-service solution available anytime, anywhere, on any device. Please read this Terms of Service agreement carefully before accessing or using SaaS Company. Because it is such an important contract between us and our users, we have tried to make it as clear as possible. For your convenience, we have presented these terms in a short non-binding summary followed by the full legal terms.</p>

        <p class="mb-3"><b>Effective July 01, 2050</b></p>

        <h2 class="text-dark mt-5">Definitions</h2>
        <p><b>Short version</b>: <i>We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.</i><p>

        <p>The "Agreement" refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the "Terms of Service" or the "Terms") and all other operating rules and policies including the SaaS Company <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> that we may publish from time to time on the Website.</p>

        <p>The "Service" refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by SaaS Company.</p>

        <p>The "Website" refers to SaaS Company's website located at ExampleDomain.com, and all content, services, and products provided by SaaS Company at or through the Website. It also refers to SaaS Company owned subdomains of ExampleDomain.com, such as app.ExampleDomain.com. These Terms also govern SaaS Company's conference websites. Occasionally, websites owned by SaaS Company may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.</p>

        <p>The "User", "You," and "Your" refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 18 years of age. </p>

        <p>"SaaS Company", "We", and "Us" refer to SaaS Company, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.</p>

        <p>"Content" refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. "User-Generated Content" is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.</p>

        <p>An "Account" represents your legal relationship with SaaS Company. A "User Account" represents an individual User's authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User's identity on SaaS Company. "Organizations" are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A User Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Account Terms</h3>

        <p><b>Short version</b>: <i>User Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 18 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.</i></p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Account Controls</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Users</b>. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your User Account and the Content within it.</li>

            <li><b>Organizations</b>. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization's data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one User Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Required Information</h3>
        <p>You must provide a valid email address, name and phone number in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a paid Account, in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Account Requirements</h3>
        <p>We have a few simple rules for User Accounts on SaaS Company's Service.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts.
                A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free User Account.
                One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).</li>
            <li>You must be age 18 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. SaaS Company does not target our Service to children under 18, and we do not permit any Users under 18 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 18, we will terminate that User's Account immediately. If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country's minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country's laws.</li>
            <li>Your login may only be used by one person â€” i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many User Accounts as your subscription allows.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">User Account Security</h3>
        <p>You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools  to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).</li>
            <li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. SaaS Company cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
            <li>You will promptly notify SaaS Company if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Additional Terms</h3>
        <p>In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of SaaS Company. For example, you may be a member of an organization on SaaS Company with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with SaaS Company; or you may use SaaS Company to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Conduct Restrictions</h3>

            <li>use our servers for any form of excessive automated bulk activity (for example, spamming), or relay any other form of unsolicited advertising or solicitation through our servers, such as get-rich-quick schemes;</li>
            <li>attempt to disrupt or tamper with SaaS Company's servers in ways that could harm our Website or Service, to place undue burden on SaaS Company's servers through automated means, or to access SaaS Company's Service in ways that exceed your authorization;</li>
            <li>impersonate any person or entity, including any of our employees or representatives, including through false association with SaaS Company, or by fraudulently misrepresenting your identity or site's purpose; or</li>
            <li>violate the privacy of any third party, such as by posting another person's personal information without consent.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Services Usage Limits</h3>
        <p>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Service, use of the Service, or access to the Service without SaaS Company's express written permission.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Scraping</h3>
        <p>Scraping refers to extracting data from our Website via an automated process, such as a bot or webcrawler. It does not refer to the collection of information through SaaS Company's API. You may not scrape the website.</p>


        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Privacy</h3>
        <p>Misuse of SaaS Company Users' Personal Information is prohibited.</p>

        <p>Any person, entity, or service collecting data from SaaS Company must comply with the SaaS Company <a href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, particularly in regards to the collection of our Users' Personal Information (as defined in the SaaS Company Privacy Policy). If you collect any SaaS Company User's Personal Information from SaaS Company, you agree that you will only use the Personal Information you gather for the purpose for which our User has authorized it. You agree that you will reasonably secure any Personal Information you have gathered from SaaS Company, and you will respond promptly to complaints, removal requests, and "do not contact" requests from SaaS Company or SaaS Company Users.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Excessive Bandwidth Use</h3>
        <p>If we determine your bandwidth usage to be significantly excessive in relation to other SaaS Company customers, we reserve the right to suspend your Account or throttle your file hosting until you can reduce your bandwidth consumption.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">User Protection</h3>
        <p>You agree not to engage in activity that significantly harms our Users. We will resolve disputes in favor of protecting our Users as a whole.</p>


        <h2 class="text-dark mt-5">Private projects</h2>
        <p><b>Short version</b>: <i>Your projects are private. We treat the content of private projects as confidential, and we only access it for support reasons, with your consent, or if required to for security reasons.</i></p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Control of Private projects</h3>
        <p>Some Accounts, such as paid Accounts, may have private projects, which allow the User to control access to Content.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Confidentiality of Private projects</h3>
        <p>SaaS Company considers the contents of private projects to be confidential to you. SaaS Company will protect the contents of private projects from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.</p>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Access</h3>
        <p>SaaS Company employees may only access the content of your private projects in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>With your consent and knowledge, for support reasons. If SaaS Company accesses a private procedure for support reasons, we will only do so with the owner's consent and knowledge.</li>
            <li>When access is required for security reasons, including when access is required to maintain ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of SaaS Company's systems and Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You may choose to enable additional access to your private projects. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You may enable various SaaS Company services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private projects. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but SaaS Company will continue to treat your private procedure Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the SaaS Company Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="h4 mt-3">Exclusions</h3>
        <p>If we have reason to believe the contents of a private procedure are in violation of the law or of these Terms, we have the right to access, review, and remove them. Additionally, we may be compelled by law to disclose the contents of your private projects.</p>

        <p>If we change the price for a Paid Subscription, we will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Paid Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change.
