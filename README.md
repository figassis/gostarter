# SaaS Startup Kit
[![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pipelines) 
[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit?style=flat-square)](https://goreportcard.com/report/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops)


The [SaaS Startup Kit](https://saasstartupkit.com/) is a set of libraries in Go and boilerplate Golang code for building 
scalable software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications. The goal of this project is to provide a proven starting point for new 
projects that reduces the repetitive tasks in getting a new project launched to production that can easily be scaled 
and ready to onboard enterprise clients. It uses minimal dependencies, implements idiomatic code and follows Golang 
best practices. Collectively, the toolkit lays out everything logically to minimize guess work and enable engineers to 
quickly load a mental model for the project. This inturn will make current developers happy and expedite on-boarding of 
new engineers. 

This project should not be considered a web framework. It is a starter toolkit that provides a set of working examples 
to handle some of the common challenges for developing SaaS using Golang. Coding is a discovery process and with that, 
it leaves you in control of your projectâ€™s architecture and development. 

SaaS product offerings generally provide a web-based service using a subscription model. They typically provide at 
least two main components: a REST API and a web application.

## Join our Email List

Hate emails? I do too. But if want to keep updated on important updates and releases, 
you should subscribe to our email list on the [SaaS Startup Kit website](https://saasstartupkit.com/). 
We will only email when it is really really important. Other than that, you won't recieve 
any email from us. 


## Motivation

When getting started building SaaS, we believe that is important for both the frontend web experience and the backend 
business logic (business value) be developed in the same codebase - using the same language for the frontend and backend
development in the same single repository. We believe this for two main reasons:
1. Keeps the product codebase simple and thus easy to load complete mental model.
2. Minimize cross project/team coordination

Once the SaaS product has gained market traction and the core set of functionality has been identified to achieve 
product-market fit, the functionality could be re-written with a language that would improve user experience or 
further increase efficiency. Two good examples of this would be:
1. Developing an iPhone or Android app. The front end web application provided by this project is responsive 
to support mobile devices. However, there may be a point that developing native would provide an enhanced experience. 
2. The backend business logic has a set of methods that handle small data transformations on a massive scale. If the code 
for this is relatively small and can easily be rewritten, it might make sense to rewrite this directly in C or Rust. 
This is a very rare case as GoLang is already a preformat language. 

There are five areas of expertise that an engineer or engineering team must do for a project to grow and scale. 
Based on our experience, a few core decisions were made for each of these areas that help you focus initially on 
building the business logic.
1. Micro level - The semantics that cover how data is defined, the relationships and how the data is being captured. This 
project aims for packages to be developed distinct levels that are loosely coupled and highly cohesive. Data models 
should not be part of feature functionality. It's easy for early products to be overly dependent on single models that 
starts to introduce significant risk to product stability and slows development considerably. We want to avoid 
situations were a 1 change can affect 30k lines of code.
2. Macro level - The architecture and its design provides basic project structure and the foundation for development. 
This project provides a good set of examples for a variety of common product needs.  
3. Business logic - The code for the business logic facilitates value generating activities for the business. This 
project provides an example Golang package that helps illustrate how business logic can be implemented and delivered 
delivered to clients.
4. Deployment and Operations - Get the code to production! This usually requires an entirely separate expertise. 
Instead a comprehensive CI pipeline is provided to create scaleable serverless infrastructure. 
5. Observability - Ensure the code is running as expected in a remote environment. This project implements Datadog to 
facilitate exposing metrics, logs and request tracing to obverse and validate your services are stable and responsive 
 for your clients (hopefully paying clients).

## Description

The example project is a complete startup kit for building SasS with GoLang. It provides two example services:
* Web App - Responsive web application to provide service to clients. Includes user signup and user authentication for 
direct client interaction via their web browsers. 
* Web API - REST API with JWT authentication that renders results as JSON. This allows clients and other third-party 
companies to develop deep integrations with the project.

The example project also provides these tools:
* Schema - Creating, initializing tables of Postgres database and handles schema migration. 
* Dev Ops - Deploying project to AWS with GitLab CI/CD.

It contains the following features:
* Minimal web application using standard html/template package.
* Auto-documented REST API.
* Middleware integration.
* Database support using Postgres.
* Cache and key value store using Redis
* CRUD based pattern.
* Role-based access control (RBAC).
* Account signup and user management.  
* Distributed logging and tracing.
* Integration with Datadog for enterprise-level observability. 
* Testing patterns.
* Build, deploy and run application using Docker, Docker Compose, and Makefiles.
* Vendoring dependencies with Modules, requires Go 1.13 or higher.
* Continuous deployment pipeline. 
* Serverless deployments with AWS ECS Fargate.
* CLI with boilerplate templates to reduce repetitive copy/pasting.
* Integration with GitLab for enterprise-level CI/CD.

Accordingly, the project architecture is illustrated with the following diagram. 
![SaaS Startup Kit diagram](resources/images/saas-stater-kit-diagram.png)


### Example project 

With SaaS, a customer subscribes to an online service you provide them. The example project provides functionality for 
customers to subscribe. Once subscribed, they can interact with your software service. 

The initial contributors to this project are building this SaaS Startup Kit based on their years of experience building 
enterprise B2B SaaS. Particularly, this SaaS Startup Kit is based on their most recent experience building the
B2B SaaS for [standard operating procedure software](https://keeni.space) (written entirely in Golang). Please refer 
to the Keeni.Space website, its [SOP software pricing](https://keeni.space/pricing) and its signup process. The SaaS web 
app is then available at [app.keeni.space](https://app.keeni.space). They are leveraging this most recent experience to 
build a simplified set example services for both a web API and a web app for SaaS businesses. 

For this example, *checklists* will be the single business logic package that will be exposed to users for management 
based on their role. Additional business logic packages can be added to support your project. It's important at the 
beginning to minimize the connection between business logic packages on the same horizontal level. 


This project provides the following functionality to users:

New customers can sign up which creates an account and a user with role of admin.
* Users with the role of admin can manage users for their account. 
* Authenticated users can manage their checklists based on RBAC.

The project implements RBAC with two basic roles for users: admin and user. 
* The role of admin provides the ability to perform all CRUD actions on checklists and users. 
* The role of user limits users to only view checklists and users. 

Of course, this example implementation of RBAC can be modified and enhanced to meet your requirements. 

The project groups code in three distinct directories:
* Cmd - all application stuff (routes and http transport)
* Internal - all business logic (compiler protections) 
* Platform - all foundation stuff (kit)

All business logic should be contained as a package inside the internal directory. This enables both the web app and web 
API to use the same API (Golang packages) with the only main difference between them is their response, HTML or JSON.

The web API and web app have similar functionality. While the web app is meant for humans to experience and requires
a friendly UI, the web API is meant for customers or third-party partners of your SaaS to programmatically integrate. To 
help show the similarities and differences between the pages in the web app and similar endpoints in the web API, we 
have created this diagram below. Since it is very detailed, you can click on the image to see the larger version.

## Local Installation

Docker is required to run this project on your local machine. This project uses multiple open-source services that will 
be hosted locally via Docker. 
* Postgres - Transactional database to handle persistence of all data.
* Redis - Key / value storage for sessions and other data. Used only as ephemeral storage.
* Datadog - Provides metrics, logging, and tracing.

An AWS account is required for deployment for the following AWS dependencies:
* Secret Manager - Provides store for private key used for JWT.
* S3 - Host static files on S3 with additional CDN support with CloudFront.
* ECS Fargate - Serverless deployments of application. 
* RDS - Cloud hosted version of Postgres. 
* Route 53 - Management of DNS entries. 


### Getting the project

Clone the repo into your desired location. This project uses Go modules and does not need to be in your GOPATH. You will 
need to be using Go >= 1.11.

You should now be able to clone the project. 

```bash
$ git clone git@gitlab.com:geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit.git
$ cd saas-starter-kit/
```

If you have Go Modules enabled, you should be able compile the project locally. If you have Go Modules disabled, see 
the next section.


### Go Modules

This project is using Go Module support for vendoring dependencies. 

If already on running Go 1.13 and above, Go Modules are enabled by default. You can check the current version of Go by 
using the `go version` command. 
```bash
$ go version 
``` 

It is required to enable Go Modules for Go 1.13 and below. 

```bash
$ echo "export  GO111MODULE=on" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

The `tidy` command will fetch all the project dependencies. 

```bash
$ GO111MODULE=on go mod tidy
```


### Installing Docker

Docker is a critical component and required to run this project.

https://docs.docker.com/install/

    
## Getting started

### Video tutorials 

Three screen casts have be created by @huyng to provide additional help getting started. 

1. [Create Repo from SaaS Startup Kit Golang](https://youtu.be/sA5oeuTrsZM)

2. [Change References for SaaS Startup Kit Golang](https://youtu.be/sA5oeuTrsZM)

3. [Configure GitLab Runner for SaaS Startup Kit Golang](https://youtu.be/yIGSpZVDnlM)


### Setup local environment

There is a `docker-compose` file that knows how to build and run all the services. Each service has its own a 
`dockerfile`.

Before using `docker-compose`, you need to copy `configs/sample.env_docker_compose` to `.env_docker_compose` that docker will use. When you run `docker-compose up` it will run all the services including the main.go file for each Go service. The 
following services will run:
- web-api
- web-app 
- postgres

### Execute initial database migrations

Before you can run the project, you will need to load the initial database schema. This can be run using [tools/schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/tools/schema). 
Refer to the [README](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/tools/schema/README.md) for additional usage details.

```bash
go run tools/schema/main.go migrate
``` 

### Running the project

Use the `docker-compose.yaml` to run all of the services, including the third-party services. The first time to run this 
command, Docker will download the required images for the 3rd party services.

```bash
$ cp configs/sample.env_docker_compose configs/.env_docker_compose
$ docker-compose up
```

Default configuration is set which should be valid for most systems. 

Use the `docker-compose.yaml` file to configure the services differently using environment variables when necessary. 

#### How we run the project

We like to run the project where the services run in the background of our CLI. This can be done by using the -d with 
the `docker-compose up --build` command: 
```bash
$ docker-compose up --build -d
```

Then when we want to see the logs, we can use the `docker-compose logs` command:
```bash
$ docker-compose logs
```

Or we can tail the logs using this command:
```bash
$ docker-compose logs -f
```


### Stopping the project

You can hit `ctrl-C` in the terminal window that ran `docker-compose up`. 

Once that shutdown sequence is complete, it is important to run the `docker-compose down` command.

```bash
$ <ctrl>C
$ docker-compose down
```

Running `docker-compose down` will properly stop and terminate the Docker Compose session.

Note: None of the containers are setup by default with volumes and all data will be lost with `docker-compose down`. 
This is specifically important to remember regarding the Postgres container. If you would like data to be persisted across 
builds locally, update `docker-compose.yaml` to define a volume. 


### Re-starting a specific Go service for development

When writing code in an iterative fashion, it is nice to have your change automatically rebuilt. This project uses 
[github.com/gravityblast/fresh](https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh) to recompile your services that will include most
changes. 

    Fresh is a command line tool that builds and (re)starts your web application everytime you save a Go or template file. 
     
The [Fresh configuration file](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/configs/fresh-auto-reload.conf) 
is located in the project root. By default the following folders are watched by Fresh:
- handlers
- static
- templates

Any changes to [internal/*](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/internal) or 
additional project dependencies added to [go.mod](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/go.mod) 
will require the service to be rebuilt. 


```bash
docker-compose up  --build -d web-app
```


### Forking your own copy 

1. Checkout the project

2. Update references.
```bash
flist=`grep -r "geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit" * | awk -F ':' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq`
for f in $flist; do echo $f; sed -i "" -e "s|geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit|geeks-accelerator/oss/aurora-cam|g" $f; done


flist=`grep -r "saas-starter-kit" * | awk -F ':' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq`
for f in $flist; do echo $f; sed -i "" -e "s|saas-starter-kit|aurora-cam|g" $f; done


flist=`grep -r "example-project" * | awk -F ':' '{print $1}' | sort | uniq`
for f in $flist; do echo $f; sed -i "" -e "s|example-project|aurora-cam|g" $f; done


```

3. Create a new AWS Policy with the following details:
```

                     ]
                 }
```

Create a new user with programmatic access and directly attach it the policy `SaasStarterKitDevServices`

4. Create a new docker-compose config file
```bash
 cp configs/sample.env_docker_compose configs/.env_docker_compose 
```

5. Update .env_docker_compose with the Access key ID and Secret access key  

6. Update `.gitlab-ci.yml` with relevant details. 


### Optional. Set AWS and Datadog Configs

By default the project will compile and run without AWS configs or other third-party dependencies. 

As you start utilizing AWS services in this project and/or ready for deployment, you will need to start specifying 
AWS configs in a docker-compose file. You can also set credentials for other dependencies in the new docker-compose file 
too.

The sample docker-compose file is not loaded since it is named sample, which allows the project to run without these 
configs.

To set AWS configs and credentials for other third-party dependencies, you need to create a copy of the sample 
environment docker-compose file without "sample" prepending the file name. 

Navigate to the root of the project. Copy `configs/sample.env_docker_compose` to `.env_docker_compose`. 

```bash
$ cd ./saas-starter-kit
$ cp configs/sample.env_docker_compose configs/.env_docker_compose
```

The example the docker-compose file specifies these environmental variables. The $ means that the variable is commented 
out.
```
$ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
$ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
$ AWS_USE_ROLE=false
$ DD_API_KEY=
```

In your new copy of the example docker-compose file ".env_docker_compose", set the AWS configs by updating the following 
environment variables: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, and AWS_DEFAULT_REGION. Remember to remove the $ before the 
variable name. 

As noted in the Local Installation section, the project is integrated with Datadog for observability. You can specify 
the API key for your Datadog account by setting the environment variable: DD_API_KEY.


## Web API
[cmd/web-api](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/cmd/web-api)

REST API is available to clients for supporting deeper integrations. This API is also a foundation for third-party 
integrations. The API implements JWT authentication that renders results as JSON to clients. 

Once the web-api service is running it will be available on port 3001.

This web-api service is not directly used by the web-app service to prevent locking the functionally required for 
internally development of the web-app service to the same functionality exposed to clients via this web-api service. 
This separate web-api service can be exposed to clients and be maintained in a more rigid/structured process to manage 
client expectations.

The web-app has its own internal API, similar to this external web-api service, but not exposed for third-party 
integrations. It is believed that in the beginning, having to define an additional API for internal purposes is worth 
for the additional effort as the internal API can support increased release velocity and handle more flexible updates. 

For more details on this service, read [web-api readme](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/cmd/web-api/README.md)

## Web App
[cmd/web-app](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/cmd/web-app)

Responsive web application that renders HTML using the `html/template` package from the standard library to enable 
direct interaction with clients and their users. It allows clients to sign up new accounts and provides user 
authentication with HTTP sessions. The web app relies on the Golang business logic packages developed to provide an API 
for internal requests. 

Once the web-app service is running it will be available on port 3000. 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/

The web-app service is a fully functioning example. You can see an example of this Golang web-app service running here:
https://example.saasstartupkit.com

The example web-app service includes complete working example of a responsible mobile-first web app for 
software-as-a-service and example business logic Go packages facilitating create, read, update and delete operations.
It also includes signup for customers to subscribe to your SaaS, user auth for login/logout, and admin functionality  
of user management.

## Schema 
[cmd/schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/cmd/schema)

Schema is a minimalistic database migration helper that can manually be invoked via CLI. It provides schema versioning 
and migration rollback. 

The schema for the entire project is defined globally and is located inside internal: 
[internal/schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/internal/schema)

Keeping a global schema helps ensure business logic can be decoupled across multiple packages. It is a firm belief that 
data models should not be part of feature functionality. Globally defined structs are dangerous as they create large 
code dependencies. Structs for the same database table can be defined by package to help mitigate large code 
dependencies. 

The example schema package provides two separate methods for handling schema migration:

* [Migrations](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/internal/schema/migrations.go) -
List of direct SQL statements for each migration with defined version ID. A database table is created to persist 
executed migrations. Upon run of each schema migration run, the migraction logic checks the migration database table to 
check if itâ€™s already been executed. Thus, schema migrations are only ever executed once. Migrations are defined as a 
function to enable complex migrations so results from query manipulated before being piped to the next query. 

* [Init Schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/internal/schema/init_schema.go) - 
If you have a lot of migrations, it can be a pain to run all them. For example, when you are deploying a new instance of 
the app into a clean database. To prevent this, use the initSchema function that will run as-if no migration was run 
before (in a new clean database). 

Another bonus with the globally defined schema is that it enables the testing package to spin up database containers 
on-demand and automatically include all the migrations. This allows the testing package to programmatically execute 
schema migrations before running any unit tests. 


### Accessing Postgres 

To login to the local Postgres container and query the database tables, use the following command:
```bash
docker exec -it saas-starter-kit_postgres_1 /bin/bash
bash-5.0# psql -U postgres shared
```

The example project currently only includes a few tables. As more functionality is built into both the web-app and 
web-api services, the number of tables will expand. You can use the `show tables` command to list them. 
```commandline
shared=# \dt
             List of relations
 Schema |      Name      | Type  |  Owner   
--------+----------------+-------+----------
 public | accounts       | table | postgres
 public | migrations     | table | postgres
 public | checklists     | table | postgres
 public | users          | table | postgres
 public | users_accounts | table | postgres
(5 rows)
``` 

An alternative option would be to install [pgcli](https://www.pgcli.com/) locally on your machine and connect to the 
database running inside the docker container. 


## Deployment 

This project includes a complete build pipeline that relies on AWS and GitLab. The presentation 
"[SaaS Startup Kit - Setup GitLab CI / CD](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sRFQwipziZlxBtN7xuF-ol8vtUqD55l_4GE-4_ns-qM/edit#slide=id.p)" 
has been made available on Google Docs that provides a step by step guide to setting up a build pipeline using your own 
AWS and GitLab accounts.  

Google Slides on Setting Up Gitlab CI/CD for SaaS Startup Kit:
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sRFQwipziZlxBtN7xuF-ol8vtUqD55l_4GE-4_ns-qM/edit#slide=id.p

*You are welcome to add comments to the Google Slides.*


The `.gitlab-ci.yaml` file includes the following build 
stages: 
```yaml
stages:
  - build:dev     # Build containers with configs targeting dev env.
  - migrate:dev   # Run database migration against the dev database.
  - deploy:dev    # Deploy the containers built for dev env to AWS ECS. 
  - build:stage   # Build containers with configs targeting stage env.
  - migrate:stage # Run database migration against the stage database.
  - deploy:stage  # Deploy the containers built for stage env to AWS ECS. 
  - build:prod    # Build containers with configs targeting prod env.
  - migrate:prod  # Run database migration against the prod database.
  - deploy:prod   # Deploy the containers built for prod env to AWS ECS. 
```

Currently `.gitlab-ci.yaml` only defines jobs for the first three stages. The remaining stages can be chained together 
so each job is dependant on the previous or run jobs for each target environment independently. 

A build tool called [devops](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/tools/devops) has 
been included apart of this project. _Devops_ handles creating AWS resources and deploying your services with minimal 
additional configuration. You can customize any of the configuration in the code. While AWS is already a core part of 
the saas-starter-kit, keeping the deployment in GoLang limits the scope of additional technologies required to get your 
project successfully up and running. If you understand Golang, then you will be a master at devops with this tool.

Refer to the [README](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/tools/devops/README.md) for 
setup details. 


## Development Notes

### Country / Region / Postal Code Support 

This project uses [geonames.org](https://www.geonames.org/) to populate database tables for countries, postal codes and 
timezones that help facilitate standardizing user input. To keep the schema script quick for `dev`, the postal codes for 
only country code `US` are loaded. This can be changed as needed in 
[geonames.go](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/internal/geonames/geonames.go#L30).

### Datadog

Datadog has a custom init script to support setting multiple expvar urls for monitoring. The docker-compose file then 
can set a single env variable.
```bash
DD_EXPVAR=service_name=web-app env=dev url=http://web-app:4000/debug/vars|service_name=web-api env=dev url=http://web-api:4001/debug/vars
```

### SQLx bindvars

When making new packages that use sqlx, bind vars for mysql are `?` where as postgres is `$1`.

To database agnostic, sqlx supports using `?` for all queries and exposes the method `Rebind` to
remap the placeholders to the correct database.

```go
sqlQueryStr = db.Rebind(sqlQueryStr)
```

For additional details refer to [bindvars](https://jmoiron.github.io/sqlx/#bindvars)
