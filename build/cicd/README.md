cicd 
=== 

_cicd_ is a simple command line tool that facilitates build and deployment for your project. The goal is to help enable 
developers to easily setup a continuous build pipeline using [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) and code 
driven deployment.

## Overview

The command line tool provides the functionality to configure, build and deploy your code. When new code is push to GitLab, 
this tool will enable building, testing and deploying your code to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). 
 
Deploying your code to production always requires additional tooling and configuration. Instead of patching together a 
system of of existing tools and configuration files. This tool centralizes configuration for the application and any 
additional deployment resources needed. 

Configuration is define with code. AWS resources are created/maintained using the [AWS SDK for Go](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/).

**This tool is used by GitLab CI/CD** and is configured by a file called `.gitlab-ci.yml` placed at the repository’s root. 

**All code is deployed to Amazon AWS**. 

Check out the [full presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sRFQwipziZlxBtN7xuF-ol8vtUqD55l_4GE-4_ns-qM/edit?usp=sharing) 
that covers how to setup your [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) pipeline that uses autoscaling GitLab 
Runners on AWS.

Support is provided for both services and functions. The build process for both relies on docker and thus, neither are 
required to be written in go. 

Configuration for build and deploy is provided by 
[gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy)

For additional details regarding this tool, refer to 
[gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops)



### Deployment Environments 

All configuration for the deployment environments is defined in code that is located in the 
[internal/config](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/build/cicd/internal/config) 
package. This includes configuration for the following deployment resources:

* [AWS ECR Repository](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsEcrRepository) 
named `saas-starter-kit`

* [AWS EC2 VPC](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsEc2Vpc) defined as using the 
default for the AWS Region. 

* [AWS EC2 Security Group](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsEc2SecurityGroup) 
named `saas-starter-kit-[dev|stage|prod]`
    * The name of the GitLab runner security group as `gitlab-runner` that will be added to the security group as ingress.  

* Private [AWS S3 Bucket](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsS3Bucket) 
named `saas-starter-kit-private` used by the `web-app` and `web-api` for large object storage. 
    * A lifecycle policy is applied to the key prefix `tmp/` that will expire objects after 1 day for temporary storage 
    like exports. 
    * Configured to [block all public access](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-block-public-access-another-layer-of-protection-for-your-accounts-and-buckets/)
    
* Public [AWS S3 Bucket](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsS3Bucket) 
named `saas-starter-kit-public` used to serve static files primary for the `web-app`. 
    * CORS rules for GET and POST to support static files served directly from the S3 Bucket or via Cloudfront. 
    * Defined key prefix of `public/` used by deployment for uploading static files.
    * AWS CloudFront configured for the `prod` environment for serving static files from the S3 Bucket as origin. 

* Redis [AWS Elastic Cache Cluster](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsElasticCacheCluster) 
named `saas-starter-kit-[dev|stage|prod]` for ephemeral storage. 
    * Configured using Redis version 5.0.4.
    * Deployed as a single node cache cluster using the instance type `cache.t2.micro`, 1vCPU with 512mbs of memory.
    * `maxmemory-policy` parameter set to `allkeys-lru` which will evict keys by trying to remove the less recently used 
    (LRU) keys first, in order to make space for the new data added. This will prevent the cache cluster from ever 
    running out of memory. 
     			
* Postgres [AWS RDS Database Instance](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsRdsDBInstance) 
named `saas-starter-kit-[dev|stage|prod]`.
    * Configured with the default database `shared`, username `god` on port 5432.
    * The password is randomly generated during creation and stored in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/).
    * Deployed as a single instance using the instance type `db.t2.small`, 1vCPU with 2GiB of memory. 
    * 20GiB of disk space has been allocated.  

* [AWS Iam Policy](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsIamPolicy) named 
`saasStarterKitService[Dev|Stage|Prod]` that will be used to grants permissions for AWS ECS tasks and AWS Lambda 
functions to access to the defined AWS resources listed above. 

* Support for datadog can be enabled by added your Datadog API key to [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) 
 using the key `saas-starter-kit/[dev|stage|prod]/datadog`
 
 
Multiple development environments can easily be configured for more control. This tool supports three target deployment 
environments: 
* dev
* stage 
* prod  

`.gitlab-ci.yml` only has prod enabled. 
 
 

### Services 
Services are generally applications that will need to be long running or continuously available. The configured services  
are:

* [web-app](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/cmd/web-app) - Publicly accessible 
website and web application. 
* [web-api](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/cmd/web-api) - Publicly accessible web 
API and documentation. 


The `Dockerfile` for both services is defined as [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) 
that includes building a base layer, running unittests and compiling the go application as static binary. The final 
layer in the multi-stage uses [alpine:3.11](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine?tab=description) as its base image and copies 
in the compiled binary resulting in a docker container that is around 50mbs excluding any additional static assets. It's 
possible to swap out `alpine:3.11` with [busybox](https://willschenk.com/articles/2019/building_a_slimmer_go_docker_container/) 
for an even small resulting docker image. 

A service is built using the defined service Dockerfile. The resulting image is pushed to 
[Amazon Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). 

    Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully-managed Docker container registry that makes it easy for 
    developers to store, manage, and deploy Docker container images. Amazon ECR is integrated with Amazon Elastic 
    Container Service (ECS) simplifying the development to production workflow. 
 
A service is configured for deployment in [services.go](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/oss/devops/blob/master/build/cicd/internal/config/service.go).
Services are deployed to [AWS Fargate](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/) based on the defined task definition. 
    
    AWS Fargate is a compute engine for Amazon ECS that allows you to run containers without having to manage servers or 
    clusters. With AWS Fargate, you no longer have to provision, configure, and scale clusters of virtual machines to 
    run containers.  
 
If the docker file is a multi-stage build and it contains a stage with the name `build_base_golang`, additional caching will 
be implemented to reduce build times. The build command assumes for a stage named `build_base_golang` assumes that the 
stage will run `go mod download` to pull down all package dependencies. The build command computes a checksum for the 
project go.mod and then executes a docker build that targets the specific stage `build_base_golang`. The built container 
image is tagged with the go.mod hash and pushed to the projects 
[GitLab repository](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/). 



### Functions 

Functions are applications that can be executed in short period of time. The configured function is:

*[Datadog Log Collection](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/deployments/ddlogscollector) - 
Python script used to ship logs from AWS Cloudwatch to Datadog. 


A function is built using the defined Dockerfile. The `Dockerfile` for a function should use a 
[lambdaci image](https://hub.docker.com/r/lambci/lambda/) as the base image. 
  
  Lambdaci images provide a sandboxed local environment that replicates the live AWS Lambda environment almost 
  identically – including installed software and libraries, file structure and permissions, environment variables, 
  context objects and behaviors – even the user and running process are the same.
  
The build command then uses `docker cp` to extract all files from the resulting container image that are located in 
`/var/task`. These files are zipped and uploaded to the private AWS S3 bucket for deployment. 

A function is configured for deployment in [functions.go](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/oss/devops/blob/master/build/cicd/internal/config/function.go).
Functions are deployed to [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

    AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume 
    - there is no charge when your code is not running. 



### Schema Migrations 

_cicd_ includes a minimalistic database migration script that implements 
[github.com/geeks-accelerator/sqlxmigrate](https://godoc.org/github.com/geeks-accelerator/sqlxmigrate). It provides 
schema versioning and migration rollback. The schema for the entire project is defined globally and is located at 
[internal/schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/issue8/datadog-lambda-func/internal/schema) 

The example schema package provides two separate methods for handling schema migration:
* [Migrations](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/issue8/datadog-lambda-func/internal/schema/migrations.go) -
List of direct SQL statements for each migration with defined version ID. A database table is created to persist 
executed migrations. Upon run of each schema migration run, the migration logic checks the migration database table to 
check if it’s already been executed. Thus, schema migrations are only ever executed once. Migrations are defined as a 
function to enable complex migrations so results from query manipulated before being piped to the next query. 

* [Init Schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/issue8/datadog-lambda-func/internal/schema/init_schema.go) - 
If you have a lot of migrations, it can be a pain to run all them. For example, when you are deploying a new instance of 
the app into a clean database. To prevent this, use the initSchema function that will run as-if no migration was run 
before (in a new clean database). 


**Migrations should be backwards compatible with the existing deployed code.** Refrain from `drop table`. Instead of 
renaming columns, add a new column and copy the data from the old column using an `update`. 

Ideally migrations should be idempotent to avoid possible data loss since data could have been generated between 
migration runs.

Another bonus with the globally defined schema is that it enables your testing package the ability to dynamically [spin 
up database containers](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/issue8/datadog-lambda-func/internal/platform/tests/main.go#L127) 
on-demand and automatically include all the migrations. This allows the testing package to 
[programmatically execute schema migrations](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/issue8/datadog-lambda-func/internal/platform/tests/main.go#L172) 
before running any unit tests. 



## Getting Started  

One of the philosophies behind the SaaS Startup Kit is that building and deploying SaaS product offers should be easy 
allowing you focus on what's most important, writing the business logic. Below outline the steps needed to get a 
full build pipeline that includes both continious integration and continious deployment. 

1. Configure your AWS infrastructure in [config.go](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/build/cicd/internal/config/config.go) 
 
2. Define your services in [service.go](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/build/cicd/internal/config/service.go) 
that will be deployed to AWS Fargate. This includes settings for your [AWS ECS Cluster](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsEcsCluster), 
the associated [AWS ECS Service](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsEcsService) 
and [AWS ECS Task Definition](https://godoc.org/gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/pkg/devdeploy#AwsEcsTaskDefinition). 

3. Define your functions in [function.go](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/build/cicd/internal/config/function.go) 
that will be deployed to AWS Lambda. This includes settings for the runtime, amount of memory, and timeout.
 
4. Ensure your [schema](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/internal/schema) is ready 
for deployment. You should already be using the 
[schema tool](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/tree/master/tools/schema) for maintaining 
database schemas for local development, so no additional effort should be required for this step. 

5. Update the [.gitlab-ci.yml](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/blob/master/.gitlab-ci.yml) in 
the project root to include the services and functions you have configured here. `.gitlab-ci.yml` will be used by GitLab 
to determine which services and functions should be built and deployed. 

6. Setup a GitLab runner in your AWS account. This will allow the _cicd_ tool to execute database migration since the 
database deployed by default is not publicly available. GitLab does provide shared runners, but these will not be able 
to access your database. 
[Follow the instructions here](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/blob/master/README.md#gitlab-cicd) for 
setting up a GitLab Runner. 



## Installing locally 

Make sure you have a working Go environment.  Go version 1.2+ is supported.  [See
the install instructions for Go](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).


To install _cicd_, simply run:
```
$ go get -v geeks-accelerator/oss/saas-starter-kit/build/cicd
```

Make sure your `PATH` includes the `$GOPATH/bin` directory so your commands can
be easily used:
```
export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin
```

_cicd_ requires AWS permissions to be executed locally. For the GitLab CI/CD build pipeline, AWS roles will be used. This 
user is only necessary for running _cicd_ locally. 

1. You will need an existing AWS account or create a new AWS account.

2. Define a new [AWS IAM Policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/policies$new?step=edit) 
called `saas-starter-kit-deploy` with a defined JSON statement instead of using the visual 
editor. The statement is rather large as each permission is granted individually. A copy of 
the statement is stored in the devops repo at 
[configs/aws-aim-deploy-policy.json](https://gitlab.com/geeks-accelerator/oss/devops/blob/master/configs/aws-aim-deploy-policy.json)

3. Create new [AWS User](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/users$new?step=details) 
called `saas-starter-kit-deploy` with _Programmatic Access_ and _Attach existing policies directly_ with the policy 
created from step 2 `saas-starter-kit-deploy`

4. Set your AWS credentials as [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html). 
These can also be passed into _cicd_ as command line options. 
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXXXXXXXX
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXXXXXXXX
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-west-2"
export AWS_USE_ROLE=false
```
